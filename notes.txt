--Meeting with Plante (02/25)--

- Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (KSZ) Data Set
  - Dr. Plante ran 1000 different simulations with different ionization scenarios.
  - Each simulation generated a map and tau value.
  - File format HDF5. Better efficiency for large data sets and has its own file system.

- Can do simply calculations like mean median std and plot against tau.
- Can make ML model to predict tau level (output) from photo (input)

- Will send slimmed version of data set to test.
